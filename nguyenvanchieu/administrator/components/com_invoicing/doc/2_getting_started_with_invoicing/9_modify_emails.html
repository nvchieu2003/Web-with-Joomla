<h1>Modify emails</h1>
<p>
    Here you can modify the content of the emails initially 
    set as the list shown below.
</p>

<p>
    You can notice than half of these emails are preceded by 
    "Admin" which means these are the emails that will be sent 
    to admin if you decided to enable them (you can check it 
    on the list above). Here all my mails are enabled, so they 
    all will be sent. We decided not to letting you create new 
    email because they are related to the state of the invoice 
    and triggered when it changes. You cannot send mail when 
    the order is cancelled, but you can modify the content 
    and the render, following the next step.
</p>
<p>
    You can see list of tags representing a precise data from 
    invoice or order, you can see a list with definition here : 
    <a href="">I want to change how the emails are displayed</a> ).
</p>
<p>
    You can't change the description cause it's meant to help you 
    to remember why this email is for because you can change the 
    title. Of course, you can change the content and use tags in 
    it but remember this is a template for mail so you have to 
    be aware that some templates are not compatible with all email 
    managers like Outlook and that issues could be noticed if you 
    use your own template and that it does not display correctly, 
    we advice you to keep the default template somewhere to use it 
    if yours doesn't display properly.

    Finally, you can choose whether you want a PDF version or the 
    command or the invoice send as a PDF attachment. You can see 
    on the list of emails if you chose "Yes" or "No" for each email.
