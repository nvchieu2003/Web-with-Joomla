<h1>Create client</h1>
<p>
     You can create client by clicking on the "Clients" tab 
     on Invoicing. If you activated CB, the fields below "Name" 
     will be saved on Community Builder. You have 3 options. 
     You can create a new Joomla! Account on your website with 
     the client, you can assign an existent Joomla! account or 
     just register the client on Invoicing. You can find tutorial 
     how to do it here ( 
     <a href="">I'm I want to create a client and he 
     already exists in the list of my user table.</a> ).

    Others are similar, the only thing you need to be aware of 
    is the form that appears when you click on the checkbox 
    "create a new Joomla! Account", the only restriction here 
    is to write an email adress that is not in your "User" 
    tables yet otherwise you won't be able to save it. You 
    must add a password too, if you modify some data of the 
    client later, you can let the field blank so his password 
    won't be modified.
