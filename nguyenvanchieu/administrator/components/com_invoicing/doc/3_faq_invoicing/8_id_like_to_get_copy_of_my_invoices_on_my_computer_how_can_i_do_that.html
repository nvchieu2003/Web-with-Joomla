<h1>I'd like to get copy of my invoices on my coputer, how can I do that ?</h1>
<p>
    You have to click on the "Invoices" tab, just pick the invoices 
    you want by using the filters. By default, all invoices are 
    diplayed within the pagination you've chosen. By example, if 
    you diplay twenty invoices per page but you have twenty-one 
    invoices in the component, you will have a copy of twenty-one 
    invoices except if you decided to filter as explained before.

    Once you decided, you only have to click on the "Download 
    invoices in CSV" link to get the file with CSV extension 
    with all fields for each invoices. If you want a different 
    render just check the documentation for 
    <a href="">Configuration</a>
