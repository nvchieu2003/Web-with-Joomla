<h1>I've selected logo of vendor but it doesnt display, is that normal ?</h1>
<p>
    Absolutely ! When you create a vendor and you select a 
    picture, you need to save once in order to see the file 
    you chose as the logo, to be sure you have to click on 
    the "Save" button so you can see the logo in the edition 
    list of your vendor.

    Concerning the vendor creation from invoice edition, you 
    wont be allowed to add logo, you will must modify the 
    concerned vendor from the "Vendor" tab if you want to 
    add him a logo later.
