<h1>There is a "Products References" button, what is that ?</h1>
<p>
    You are in the editing view of an invoice or quote. You've 
    chosen the client and the vendor and now you have to fill 
    the list of products. You can add one in two ways, manually 
    by filling each field of each row and add another line, 
    or if you often use a product you can use a reference product 
    previously created by clicking on the "References" tab and 
    save it. Now you can find it by clicking on the "Add reference 
    product" tab. If you want to know more about the reference 
    product you can check the following link : 
    <a href="">Create reference product</a>
