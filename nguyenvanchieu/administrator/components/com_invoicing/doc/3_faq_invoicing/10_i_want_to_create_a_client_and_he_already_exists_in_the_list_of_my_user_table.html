<h2>I want to create a client and he does already exist 
    in my users table, how can I match ?</h2>
<p>
    You must click on the "Clients" tab, then on "New". You have to 
    check the box "Assign a Joomla Account" and then you will see 
    a select dropdown with the list of your users. Just select the 
    user you want. If you have a lot of users, you can push on the 
    keyboards corresponding to the first letter and it will show 
    you all users beggining from that letter. For example, if I 
    look for "Dupont", i must click on the arrow to detail the 
    dropdown, then i pushed the "D" key and i select "Dupont" on 
    the list by clicking on it.
